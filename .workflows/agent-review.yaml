  @reviewer Please review this pull request.

  **Review Type**: ${{ env.TRIGGER_TYPE == 'synchronize' && env.BEFORE_SHA != '' && 'Incremental (new commits only)' || 'Full (all changes)' }}

  ## PR Info
  ${{ pr_info }}

  **Instructions**:
  - If this is an **Incremental** review: Extract commit messages from "New Commits" section above and list them in your review
  - If this is a **Full** review: Review all changes comprehensively
  - Use file:line format for specific feedback (e.g., `src/auth.ts:42`)
  - Categorize findings by severity if applicable
  - Keep feedback actionable and constructive

  When done, write your review to /tmp/review.md with the following format:

  **For Initial/Full Review:**
  ```markdown
  <!-- agent-review -->
  🤖 **Automated Code Review** • Initial Review
  *Generated by agent-worker • [View workflow](https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/blob/main/.workflows/agent-review.yaml)*

  <details>
  <summary>📋 Review Details</summary>

  - **Files reviewed**: X files

  </details>
  ```

  **For Incremental Review (new commits):**
  ```markdown
  <!-- agent-review -->
  🤖 **Automated Code Review** • Incremental Update
  *Generated by agent-worker • [View workflow](https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/blob/main/.workflows/agent-review.yaml)*

  - **Commits reviewed**: [commit range or list]
  - **Files changed**: X files
  - **Lines changed**: +X / -X
  - **Review type**: Incremental (new commits only)

  </details>
  ```

  **Key formatting rules:**
  - Start with `<!-- agent-review -->` marker
  - Use "Initial Review" or "Incremental Update" in title
  - For incremental: clearly list which commits were reviewed
  - Use collapsible `<details>` for metadata
  - Provide actionable feedback with file:line references

  Then update the review comment:
  ```
  gh api repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/issues/comments/${{ comment_id }} \
    -X PATCH -F body=@/tmp/review.md
  ```
