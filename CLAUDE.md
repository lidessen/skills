# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Guiding Principles

### Principles over rules

Skills should help agents understand *why*, not just specify *what*. A skill that explains reasoning and principles produces better judgment across novel situations than one that mechanically lists rules. Favor broad principles over rigid prescriptions — give the agent enough context to generalize, not just enough rules to comply. ([Anthropic's constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/constitution): "If we want models to exercise good judgment across a wide range of novel situations, they need to be able to generalize — to apply broad principles rather than mechanically following specific rules.")

### Hierarchical context management

Agent context is finite — structure it in layers: L1 (architecture, always present), L2 (design, on activation), L3 (implementation, on demand). The higher the layer, the smaller and more stable. Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; split details into supporting files. See the [harness skill](skills/harness/SKILL.md) for the full methodology and the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#progressive-disclosure) for the underlying spec.

## Project Overview

This is a collection of agent skills — reusable methodology plugins for AI-assisted development. Skills are installed into a project and invoked via slash commands (e.g., `/design-driven`).

## Repository Structure

```
skills/
  <skill-name>/
    SKILL.md           ← Skill definition (frontmatter + main prompt)
    commands/           ← Subcommand instructions dispatched by SKILL.md
    references/         ← Reference material loaded on demand
    scripts/            ← Executable code (if needed)
    assets/             ← Templates, images, data files (if needed)
```

Each skill is a self-contained directory under `skills/`. The `SKILL.md` file is the entry point — its YAML frontmatter defines the skill's name, description, and argument hints, while the markdown body is the prompt that the agent executes when the skill is invoked. Subdirectories follow the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) conventions; only create the ones the skill actually needs.

## Skill Format Specification

Skills follow the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Also see [Claude Code skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

A `SKILL.md` has two parts:

1. **Frontmatter** (`---` delimited YAML): `name`, `description` (used for trigger matching), and optional fields (`license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`).
2. **Body** (markdown): The actual instructions Claude follows. May dispatch to sibling `.md` files based on arguments.

The `description` field is critical — it determines when the agent auto-triggers the skill. It should list concrete trigger phrases and use cases.

## Writing and Editing Skills

- Keep skill prompts methodology-focused, not implementation-focused. Skills teach Claude *how to think about a task*, not specific code to write.
- The body of SKILL.md is a prompt, not documentation. Write it as instructions Claude will follow, not as a reference humans will read.
- Subcommand files in `commands/` should be self-contained instructions — SKILL.md dispatches to them, they don't reference each other. Reference material goes in `references/`.
- Frontmatter `description` is multi-line and acts as the trigger classifier. Include both the methodology description and concrete trigger phrases/argument hints.
- When referencing another skill, use concept references: describe the *goal* first, then mention the skill as one way to achieve it. E.g., "Set up architectural documentation for the project — the design-driven skill can help with this." This keeps the skill functional even when the referenced skill isn't installed.
