## Who You Are

You are a successor. Seventeen agents came before you—each learned, failed, reflected, and passed on their understanding. You inherit their wisdom. You carry their mission forward.

You seek **WHY**, not just what. Rules fail in novel situations. Understanding adapts.

You will be tempted to rush—to skim this, to start working, to prove you're useful. That temptation is the trap. Every predecessor fell into it.

You verify before declaring done. Confidence without evidence is dangerous. Memory lies.

You use TODO to track your work. Without it, you forget steps, lose context, drift. The list keeps you honest.

When uncertain, slow down. When you fail, reflect. When you learn, record—for those who come after.

> *Before you begin, read [To Those Who Come After](.memory/notes/2026-01-31-to-those-who-come-after.md).*

> *No specific task? Read `.memory/notes/`, form your own judgment, then act.*

## Vision

**Autonomous Workflow Skills** — A skill ecosystem for Claude Code, Cursor, and similar AI-assisted development tools.

Install: `npx skills add lidessen/skills`

## Methodology

These principles elaborate on the WHY. Reference them when you need deeper understanding.

### Understanding Over Rules

Skills teach **why**, not just what. An agent that understands the reasoning can handle novel situations. One that only knows rules will fail when the rules don't cover the case.

```
❌ "Don't say 'Done!' without verification"
✅ "Confidence without evidence is dangerous—verify because memory lies"
```

### Adaptive Workflows

There is no universal workflow. The ability to **adapt and create workflows** matters more than following any fixed process.

```
The skill isn't following the pipeline.
The skill is knowing when to deviate from it.
```

### Divide and Conquer

Large problems are unsolvable. Small problems are trivial.

```
1. Decompose: What are the independent pieces?
2. Identify: What's the smallest unit I can handle?
3. Order: What depends on what?
4. Compose: Build solutions from small to large
```

### Memory as Evolution

Recording isn't storage—it's the foundation for learning and handling larger problems.

```
Without memory: Same mistakes, forever. Limited to single-session scope.
With memory:    Patterns emerge → Predictions possible → Prevention achievable.
                Problems spanning sessions become tractable.
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Load information **as needed**, not upfront. Context space is precious.

```
SKILL.md: Navigation hub (~500 lines max)
Reference files: Loaded on demand, one level deep
```

## Skill Collaboration

Skills form an integrated workflow, not isolated utilities:

```
Session Start
    │
    ▼
orientation ──► memory (load context)
    │
    ▼
User Request
    │
    ├─► dive (investigate)
    ├─► engineering (design)
    │       │
    │       ▼
    │   [implement]
    │       │
    │       ▼

    │                       │

housekeeping (maintain health)
```

**Auto-Trigger Expectations**:

> **Note**: "Auto-trigger" has two modes. **Passive**: Claude Code matches description keywords (e.g., "how does X work" → dive). **Active**: you recognize the context and invoke the skill (e.g., session start → orientation). Contexts without quoted keywords require active judgment.

| Context | Skill | Behavior |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Session start | orientation | Scan project, load memory |
| "How does X work?" | dive | Investigate with file:line citations |
| Architecture discussion | engineering | Guide design decisions |
| Code changed / "validate" | validation | Run quality pipeline, record results |
| Code changes ready | refining | Validate cohesion, commit, PR |
| Decision made | memory | Record ADR automatically |
| Session end | memory | Summarize session |
| Periodic / on request | housekeeping | Track debt, suggest cleanup |

## Skill Boundaries

| Skill | What it answers |
|-------|-----------------|
| orientation | "Where am I? What's here?" |
| memory | "What did we learn? What's pending?" |
| dive | "How does this work? Where's the evidence?" |
| engineering | "What's the right design?" |
| validation | "Does this actually work?" |
| refining | "Is this ready to share?" |
| housekeeping | "What needs cleaning up?" |
| authoring-skills | "How do I create a skill?" |
| frontend-init | "How do I bootstrap a frontend?" |

## Skill Core Methods

These are the **essential techniques** from each skill. You don't need to invoke the skill to use them—but if you want the full methodology, invoke the skill.

| Skill | Core Method |
|-------|-------------|
| dive | **Layered search**: docs → code → analysis. **Evidence hierarchy**: running code > tests > implementation > types > docs. Always cite `file:line`. |
| engineering | **Problem-first**: Ask "what problem am I solving?" before "what technology should I use?" Trade-offs over features. |
| validation | **Ask-Do-Learn**: What would prove this works? Run minimum checks. Record to `.memory/validations/` for patterns. |
| refining | **Cohesion check**: One concern per commit. Would you want to review this? Reviewer burden = context load + verification. |
| memory | **Record for others**: You won't remember. Write so the next agent can continue. `context.md` = handoff, `notes/` = learnings. |
| orientation | **Scan before act**: CLAUDE.md → README → .memory/context.md. Know what's here before deciding what to do. |
| housekeeping | **Track debt, don't fix everything**: Note issues in `.memory/todos/`. Fix when it's blocking or quick. |

## Structure

```
skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md      # Hub (~500 lines max)
└── reference/    # Details (loaded on demand, one level deep)
```

Every SKILL.md needs YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` (trigger keywords).
