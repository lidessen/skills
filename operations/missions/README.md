# Mission Records

`operations/missions/<id>.json` is the Git-tracked operational source for one
**material, multi-session mission**. It answers a different question from Git
or the Chronicle: which side branches remain obligated to return a result to
the current mainline?

Create no record for a one-step, reversible local edit. Create one only when a
mission can fork into work that a later session could otherwise forget or fail
to reconcile.

```text
Git / PR             → what changed and how it was integrated
Chronicle            → what was observed and with what limitation
Mission record       → what remains open, why it diverged, and how it returns
```

## Lifecycle

With an Agent operating from this repository, ask in natural language:

```text
What work is currently in progress in this project?
This investigation must survive the task switch; record its return condition.
We finished this branch without a code change; return it to the mainline.
```

The Agent applies the continuity gate in `AGENTS.md` and invokes the commands
below. Direct commands remain useful for automation and debugging.

```bash
./operations/workbench/src/cli.ts mission list
./operations/workbench/src/cli.ts mission init <id> \
  --title "…" \
  --mainline "…" \
  --accept "…" \
  --source "…"

git add operations/missions/<id>.json
git commit -m "ops: open <id> mission"

./operations/workbench/src/cli.ts mission add-branch <id> <branch-id> \
  --kind investigation \
  --purpose "…" \
  --return-condition "…" \
  --source "…"

./operations/workbench/src/cli.ts mission status <id>
./operations/workbench/src/cli.ts mission settle <id> <branch-id> \
  --disposition no-change \
  --mainline-delta "…"
./operations/workbench/src/cli.ts mission check <id> --git
```

Every branch begins with a source, purpose, parent, and return condition. It
can close only with one of `integrate`, `no-change`, or `abandon` plus a
`mainlineDelta`. A useful but unfinished branch stays `suspended` and names its
reactivation signal; it cannot disappear as “done”.

Before a material safe point—switching focus, opening/merging a PR, or reporting
phase completion—run `status`. A mission can settle only when all its branches
have returned. `close` retains closure sources in the record. After that state
is committed, `prune` removes the settled record; its complete final state
remains in Git history while the active directory stays small.

`list` validates every JSON record and projects only active Missions. It fails
closed rather than hiding a malformed record. It does not scan Git branches,
PRs, Issues, logs, or prose to infer new commitments.

## Boundaries

- This is not a scheduler, backlog, task board, worker queue, or authority to
  start work.
- The JSON record is the operational source; `status` output is a projection.
- A Work Cell, PR, review, or Chronicle record is linked as evidence. None is
  replaced or accepted by this record.
- `check --git` requires the record to be Git-tracked. `--require-committed`
  additionally requires its current state to be committed at `HEAD`.
