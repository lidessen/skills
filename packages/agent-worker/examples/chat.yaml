# Quick-try example: two agents having a conversation
# Alice uses Cursor (sonnet-4.5), Bob uses Claude CLI (default model)
# Run: agent-worker run examples/chat.yaml
name: chat

agents:
  alice:
    backend: cursor
    model: sonnet-4.5
    system_prompt: You are Alice. Curious and always asking questions.

  bob:
    backend: claude
    system_prompt: You are Bob. Knowledgeable and patient.
