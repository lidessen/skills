# Current Stage Preparation Group Operational Review

**Status:** locally prepared for an integration PR — not push, PR, or merge authorization
**Content opinion:** [current-stage committee review](2026-07-15-current-stage-content-committee-review.md)
**Reviewed target:** `d66a125d04ad8294dbfe6742ba007ab9a5f3015b`
**Mission:** [`formal-operations-transition`](../../../operations/missions/formal-operations-transition.json), branch `current-stage-integration`

## Object and boundary

The preparation group reviews operation and maintenance: evidence retention,
verification, budget conversion, branch/PR handoff, recovery, and remaining
gates. It does not redefine project content, convert a model recommendation
into acceptance, push the branch, or merge.

## Independent review execution

The first authorized invocation failed after 40 main-loop steps because the
terminal recovery output did not inherit the structured output contract. Its
[failed-run Chronicle record](../../../chronicle/records/2026/07/obs-20260715-current-stage-review-output-recovery-failure.json)
retains the 3,281,432 reconstructed tokens, approximately USD 0.044763, the
incorrect zero-token settlement, and the absence of a usable review.

Commit `d66a125` repaired that runtime boundary and added a regression proving
that main-loop work, recovery terminal submission, structured output, and all
usage settle together. The Principal then authorized one corrected rerun. It
settled as `passed` in 79.272 seconds:

| Observation | Result |
|---|---:|
| Main-loop steps | 25 |
| File reads / listings | 59 / 8 |
| Input / cached input | 1,626,189 / 1,412,864 tokens |
| Output / total | 7,654 / 1,633,843 tokens |
| Revised-estimate ratio | 0.495104 of 3.3M |
| Estimated cost | USD 0.035965 |
| Terminal and output verification | passed / passed |

The successful run remains a local source record with digest
`2a11142e4e013113cebe2982e34ccc403694bba4f86cc53b33757c094dbb3161`;
its compact [Chronicle receipt](../../../chronicle/records/2026/07/obs-20260715-current-stage-independent-review-rerun.json)
retains the decision-relevant observations. The 14.9 MB raw trace is not added
to Git merely to make the review look more durable.

## Finding verification

The preparation group reproduced the review's only alleged blocker against the
exact target SHA and the current source tree. The named skill exists in both,
and `npm run build` succeeds with zero Astro diagnostics and eight generated
pages. The blocker and partition-C return are rejected. The CLI directory-path
message is reproducible from source but does not change safety, build, or
integration behavior. No correction branch is opened.

The report's cross-field inconsistency is retained as an operational
limitation: `outputSchema` verifies shape, while evidence and recommendation
consistency still require a caller-owned verifier. A future review-contract
improvement may separate active findings from retractions and validate
recommendation/partition agreement, but it is not a hidden precondition for
this PR because the current verifier performed that work explicitly.

## Current deterministic evidence

- Sequence snapshot dry-run passed for all packaged snapshots.
- Observation Chronicle validation and validator tests passed; the successful
  rerun receipt becomes the ninth project record.
- Mission Record tests and the active mission check passed.
- Work Cell frozen installation, typecheck, and all 69 tests / 300 assertions
  passed after the recovery repair.
- Site cold installation and prior link verification passed; the current fresh
  build again reports zero diagnostics and eight pages.
- Intervention reconciliation and install-source safety tests passed.
- `git diff --check` passes for the prepared evidence changes.

These are local and retained checks. Remote verification has not yet run on a
PR containing the complete current head.

## Operational opinion and next gate

The `current-stage-integration` branch is **ready to be committed and proposed
as one integration PR**. It is not ready to merge yet. The next authorized
movement would:

1. commit this review evidence and update the Mission Record source set;
2. push `experiment/activation-field-scale` and open one PR into `main`;
3. wait for current-head remote verification and AI review comments;
4. disposition every material comment with evidence;
5. present a compact merge / return / hold brief to the Principal.

PR #16, the 129 staged sibling-worktree entries, preparation F4, and preparation
F5 remain separate open return obligations. Opening the integration PR does not
settle them or authorize merge.

## Reopening observation

Return to execution if the PR head differs materially from the reviewed target,
remote verification fails, a review comment reproduces a material defect, or
the retained raw-run digest no longer identifies the source used by these
reports. Return to the Principal if pushing/opening the PR is not authorized.
