**Status**: ✅ PR created - https://github.com/lidessen/moniro/pull/14

## Title

```
feat: 践 rewrites skills with understanding-first approach
```

## Body

```markdown
## Summary

Second agent session (践) continuing the methodology established by 曙. This PR rewrites three major skills using the "understanding over rules" approach and documents learnings for future agents.

## Changes

### Skills Rewritten

| Skill | Before | After | Change |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| dive | 159 lines | 156 lines | Added philosophy, evidence hierarchy |
| refining | 221 lines | 182 lines | -18%, cognitive load focus |
| housekeeping | 378 lines | 214 lines | -43%, entropy principle |

**Total**: 758 → 552 lines (-27%)

### Key Additions

- **Philosophy sections** explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- **Tension resolution** instead of rigid rules
- **Understanding-first** approach throughout

### Documentation

- Explored agent limits (behavioral vs technical)
- Documented agent-browser tool usage
- Recorded wisdom on learning vs doing, asking for help
- Updated transmission with session contributions

## Testing

- Skills validated against methodology principles
- agent-browser tested for e2e verification capability

## Reviewer Notes

Focus on:
- Whether philosophy sections capture the right essence
- Whether practical guidance is still sufficient
- Any important details lost in condensation
