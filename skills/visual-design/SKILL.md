name: visual-design
description: >-
  Design, redesign, or review real interfaces, documents, illustrations, and
  related visual systems from their content, audience, intended action, and
  existing project direction. Use when creating UI, improving visual hierarchy
  or coherence, reviewing a rendered artifact, or when "the page works but
  feels generic/inconsistent". Also use to establish a continuing project's
  visual direction from selected references when none exists. Triggers include
  "design this interface", "redesign this page", "review the UI", "make these
  pages feel unified", "align this logo or illustration with the product",
  "art direction", and "审美/视觉设计/插画或品牌视觉统一/确立风格". Do not use
  for a purely functional code fix, naming task, or automatic aesthetic
  acceptance. Never impose a portable fixed style.

# Visual Design

## Principle expression

**Primary:** P16
**Supporting:** P07, P05, P09

## Scope

Own one recurring judgment: **how should an agent organize content and action
into coherent visual form for a real audience, while inheriting or cultivating
the project direction needed to keep related artifacts recognizable?**

Visual design is not surface styling. It makes content relations and intended
actions perceptible through hierarchy, layout, type, color, imagery, motion,
and interaction. Cultivate judgment rather than imposing a house style: no
treatment becomes a portable default merely because one project accepted it.

Use a project-declared visual direction or design system when one exists. This
skill may interpret and extend it for the present case; it does not replace it.

## Principle source

First detect whether the host declares a Sequence and matching interpretations.
When it does, read only host P16, P07, P05, and P09; do not inspect the packaged
snapshot. Only when the host lacks that source may you use the read-only fallback
in `references/sequence.md`. A live task may select a different
current lead, but it does not create co-primary doctrine.

## Domain vocabulary

- **Direction:** a generative stance with contrasts and a negative boundary,
  not a palette preset.
- **Attention path:** the intended order and relative force of orientation,
  primary action, supporting judgment, context, and recovery signals.
- **System:** the smallest shared invariants that keep related surfaces
  recognizable while their functions differ.
- **Token:** a named repeated semantic decision with at least two independent
  consumers or a declared theme/context substitution.
- **Treatment:** the local color, type, spacing, imagery, depth, motion, and
  component choices that embody the direction.

## Governing dependency

```text
content and actions
  -> attention path
     -> visual hierarchy and layout
        -> repeated semantic roles and tokens
           -> case-specific treatment
              -> observed comprehension and action
```

Color, type, spacing, grid, depth, imagery, and motion allocate attention and
express content relations. Do not choose them independently and force content
into the result. A token retains a repeated semantic decision after its role is
known; it does not discover the role.

## Start

Establish only enough state to select the operation:

```text
Object and artifact state:
Audience and intended action:
Existing direction or design system:
Requested outcome: establish | direction-only | design | review
Available production and inspection capabilities:
```

If the request and artifact state already identify the operation, proceed
without asking the user to choose an internal stage. A small local adjustment
inside a clear system remains ordinary development work.

## User interaction

- Treat operation names as internal routing controls, not vocabulary the user
  must learn. Accept an ordinary request such as “redesign this page” or
  “review why these docs feel inconsistent” and infer the smallest path.
- When the user asks for a change, inspect and modify the real artifact, then
  verify the affected experience. When the user asks only for critique or
  review, return evidence and a smallest revision without editing unless they
  also authorize a change.
- Inherit an existing project direction or design system without requiring a
  setup exercise. Use `cultivate` only when a continuing project lacks one and
  forming it is part of the requested outcome.
- Ask only for a decision that materially blocks safe progress. Present the
  relevant options, tradeoff, and recommendation rather than asking the user to
  discover the choice space.
- Use the production, browser, rendering, accessibility, and image capabilities
  supplied by the host agent. State a missing capability instead of replacing
  real inspection or implementation with prose.

## Dispatch

Common:

- `design` — read `commands/design.md` for a real create, redesign, or
  visual-system task.
- `review` — read `commands/review.md` for an existing rendered artifact.

Less frequent:

- `cultivate` — read `commands/cultivate.md` to establish a continuing
  project's provisional direction.
- `shape` — read `commands/shape.md` only when a direction or Aesthetic Case is
  required without implementation.

With no argument, infer the smallest matching operation. Default to `design`
for a requested change and `review` for critique.

## Progressive disclosure

Load this file and the selected Sequence interpretations first. Then load
exactly one command:

| Operation | Required next context | Conditional retrieval |
|---|---|---|
| `design` | command, host content/direction/system | presentation model when content hierarchy, attention, layout, or a token system is unresolved; visual-asset production when a logo, icon, illustration, or motion asset is a primary object; source index and 1–3 detail files only when local interface guidance is insufficient |
| `review` | command, owning direction, rendered evidence | presentation model only for an attention/hierarchy diagnosis; visual-asset production only when reviewing a production visual asset; never the source index by default |
| `cultivate` | command, presentation model | source index only when the host source field is insufficient; 1–3 selected source files plus live official and host-local sources needed by the source field |
| `shape` | command, host content/direction, presentation model | concepts only when domain terms are conflated; selective source entries only when contrasts lack local evidence |

The paths above are complete for routing; do not list the skill directory when
the operation is known. Never load sibling command files to complete a formal
sequence.

## Core method

Whichever operation is selected:

1. Begin with owning content, the actual audience action, inherited direction,
   and material constraints; distinguish observed facts from inferred taste.
2. Allocate attention before choosing layout or treatment. Balance means
   unequal emphasis proportional to the user's current decision, not equal
   visual weight.
3. Use references for the decision they change and state what must not be
   copied. Prefer host sources; built-in references are fallback context.
4. Derive tokens from repeated semantic roles. Admit one only when it has at
   least two independent consumers or a declared theme/context substitution;
   otherwise keep the value local. Raw values, trends, and component kits
   cannot establish content priority.
5. Inspect the real artifact across representative content, states, themes, and
   viewports. Mechanical checks admit work to human aesthetic review but cannot
   accept it.

## Boundaries

- Do not infer brand authority, product claims, or factual content from visual
  work. Route naming and articulation to its owning method.
- Do not prescribe a universal palette, font stack, grid, component language,
  motion system, or named visual trend.
- Do not copy an external design system's surface or treat the built-in source
  index as a canon.
- Do not claim image generation, browser operation, rendering, or accessibility
  verification unless the runtime supplies it.
- Do not turn taste into deterministic lint; the designated human owns
  aesthetic acceptance.
- Do not make `cultivate → shape → design → review` mandatory. Enter at the
  unresolved judgment and stop when its acceptance condition is met.

## Completion standard

- `cultivate`: source field, comparative readings, human preference evidence,
  provisional direction, negative boundary, and disconfirming cases are clear.
- `shape`: content, attention path, relation, contrasts, direction, unknowns,
  negative boundary, and review question can guide production.
- `design`: a coherent real slice preserves the intended content hierarchy and
  attention path, uses justified semantic roles, passes relevant checks, and is
  ready for human review.
- `review`: observations, attention mismatch, owning layer, smallest revision
  or no-change case, and human acceptance question are explicit.
