## When to Use

- Output format matters for downstream processing (JSON, API responses)
- Consistency is important across multiple uses
- Structure helps Claude understand what to include
- Users expect a specific format

## Pattern Types

### 1. Strict Templates (Required Format)

Use for API responses, data formats, or when exact structure is critical.

**Example: Report Structure**
```markdown
## Report Structure

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

\```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive Summary
[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key Findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data
- Finding 3 with supporting data

## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
3. Specific actionable recommendation

## Appendix
- Data sources used
- Methodology notes
\```

Do not deviate from this structure.
```

**Example: JSON Response**
```markdown
## API Response Format

Return EXACTLY this structure:

\```json
{
  "status": "success" | "error",
  "data": {
    "results": [...],
    "count": 0,
    "page": 1
  },
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
\```

All fields are required. Use null for optional fields when not present.
```

**When to use strict templates**:
- API responses
- Data interchange formats
- Compliance requirements
- Automated processing

### 2. Flexible Templates (Guidance)

Use when structure is helpful but adaptation is valuable.

**Example: Analysis Report**
```markdown
## Report Structure

Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment:

\```markdown
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive Summary
[Overview of analysis and main conclusions]

## Background
[Context and motivation - optional if obvious]

## Methodology
[How analysis was performed]

## Findings
[Adapt sections based on what you discover]
- Theme 1: [Details]
- Theme 2: [Details]

## Recommendations
[Tailor to the specific context]

## Limitations
[Note any caveats or constraints]
\```

Adjust sections based on the analysis type:
- Add sections for complex findings
- Omit sections that aren't relevant
- Reorder if flow improves
```

**Example: Code Documentation**
```markdown
## Documentation Template

Use this as a starting point, adapt as needed:

\```python
def function_name(param1: Type, param2: Type) -> ReturnType:
    """Brief description of what the function does.
    
    More detailed explanation if the function is complex.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When this exception occurs
        
    Example:
        >>> function_name(value1, value2)
        expected_output
    """
\```

For simple functions, brief descriptions are fine.
For complex functions, add more detail and examples.
```

**When to use flexible templates**:
- Content creation
- Documentation
- Analysis reports
- Where context determines best structure

### 3. Template with Variants

Provide multiple templates for different scenarios.

**Example: Commit Messages**
```markdown
## Commit Message Templates

Choose the appropriate template based on change type:

**Feature**:
\```
feat(scope): brief description

Detailed description of the feature
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
\```

**Bug Fix**:
\```
fix(scope): brief description

- What was broken
- How it's fixed
- How to verify the fix
\```

**Refactoring**:
\```
refactor(scope): brief description

- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Impact on functionality (if any)
\```

**Chore** (dependencies, config):
\```
chore: brief description

- List of changes
- Version updates
\```
```

**Example: Test Cases**
```markdown
## Test Templates

**Unit Test**:
\```python
def test_function_name_condition():
    # Arrange
    input_data = prepare_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = function_name(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
\```

**Integration Test**:
\```python
def test_integration_scenario():
    # Setup
    setup_test_environment()
    
    # Execute workflow
    step1_result = perform_step1()
    step2_result = perform_step2(step1_result)
    
    # Verify
    assert final_state_is_correct()
    
    # Cleanup
    teardown_test_environment()
\```
```

**When to use variants**:
- Different types of content require different structures
- Scenarios have distinct patterns
- One template doesn't fit all cases

## Template Elements

### Required Sections
Mark sections that must be present:

```markdown
## Report Structure

**Required sections**:
- Executive Summary (always include)
- Key Findings (always include)
- Recommendations (always include)

**Optional sections**:
- Background (include if context isn't obvious)
- Methodology (include for complex analysis)
- Appendix (include for supporting data)
```

### Placeholders
Use clear placeholder syntax:

```markdown
\```
# [Title - replace with actual title]

Author: [Your Name]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## [Section Name]
[Section content goes here]
\```
```

### Conditional Content
Show when sections should be included:

```markdown
## API Response Template

\```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { ... },
  "error": null,  // Only populate if status is "error"
  "pagination": { // Only include for paginated endpoints
    "page": 1,
    "total": 100
  }
}
\```
```

## Examples by Use Case

### Code Review Feedback
```markdown
## Code Review Template

\```markdown
## Summary
[One sentence overview]

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- [ ] Issue 1: [Description and location]
- [ ] Issue 2: [Description and location]

## Suggestions (Optional)
- Suggestion 1: [Description and why it would help]
- Suggestion 2: [Description and why it would help]

## Positive Notes
- [What was done well]
- [Good patterns to call out]

## Testing
- [ ] Verified tests pass
- [ ] Checked test coverage for new code
\```
```

### Database Query Results
```markdown
## Query Results Template

\```markdown
# Query: [Brief description]

## Results
- **Count**: [number] rows
- **Time**: [execution time]

## Sample Data
| Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| value   | value   | value   |

## Insights
- [Key insight 1]
- [Key insight 2]

## SQL
\```sql
[The actual query used]
\```
\```
```

### Error Reports
```markdown
## Error Report Template

\```markdown
## Error Summary
**Type**: [Error type]
**Location**: [File:line or component]
**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

## Description
[What went wrong]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Observe error]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior
[What actually happened]

## Logs/Stack Trace
\```
[Relevant logs]
\```

## Fix Suggested
[Proposed solution]
\```
```

## Combining Templates with Other Patterns

### Template + Examples Pattern
```markdown
## Commit Message Format

**Template**:
\```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation
\```

**Examples**:

\```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware
\```

\```
fix(reports): correct date formatting

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation
\```
```

### Template + Workflow Pattern
```markdown
## Report Generation Workflow

1. **Gather data**: Query all relevant sources
2. **Analyze**: Identify patterns and insights
3. **Draft report** using this template:

\```markdown
# [Report Title]
...
\```

4. **Review**: Check against quality criteria
5. **Finalize**: Save as `report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
```

## Testing Templates

Verify your template by checking:
1. **Can Claude fill it out?** Try with real data
2. **Is required content clear?** No ambiguity about what goes where
3. **Is it flexible enough?** Works for typical variations
4. **Is it strict enough?** Maintains needed consistency

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Template Too Complex
```markdown
❌ Bad:
# [Title matching pattern: Verb + Noun + Context + Date]

## Executive Summary (50-100 words, no more than 3 sentences...)
[Paragraph with specific structure: Problem + Solution + Impact]

## Background (Optional if... Multiple conditions)
...
```

**Fix**: Simplify
```markdown
✅ Good:
# [Analysis Title]

## Executive Summary
[One paragraph: key findings and impact]

## Background
[Include if context isn't obvious]
```

### Mistake 2: Template Too Vague
```markdown
❌ Bad:
\```
Put your report content here
Include the important parts
Organize it nicely
\```
```

**Fix**: Provide structure
```markdown
✅ Good:
\```markdown
# [Report Title]

## Summary
[Key findings in one paragraph]

## Details
[Supporting information]

## Recommendations
[Action items]
\```
```

### Mistake 3: No Examples
```markdown
❌ Bad:
Use this format:
type(scope): description

[body]
```

**Fix**: Show examples
```markdown
✅ Good:
**Template**: type(scope): description

**Example**:
feat(auth): add login endpoint

Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
```
