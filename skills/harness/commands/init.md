# harness:init — Bootstrap a project's harness from scratch

Set up the foundational context architecture for a new or un-configured 
project. The goal is to give any agent working in this project the right 
information at the right layer from day one.

## Process

### 1. Understand the project

Before writing anything, explore:

```
Shape        What is this project? (language, framework, monorepo/single)
             Look at: package manifests, build config, directory structure

Scale        How complex is it? (single service, multi-module, microservices)
             This determines how much L1/L2 structure is needed

Tooling      Which AI tools does the team use?
             Look at: existing CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, AGENTS.md, etc.

Workflow     How does the team develop? (PR flow, CI, deploy)
             Look at: .github/, Makefile, scripts/, CI config
```

### 2. Design the layer structure

Based on project complexity, decide what goes where:

**Small project** (single module, <10k LOC):
- L1: CLAUDE.md with build commands + key conventions
- L2: Probably not needed yet
- L3: Code speaks for itself

**Medium project** (multiple modules, 10k–100k LOC):
- L1: CLAUDE.md with architecture overview + build commands
- L2: design/DESIGN.md for module boundaries (consider design-driven skill)
- L3: Supporting docs as needed

**Large project** (many modules, >100k LOC):
- L1: CLAUDE.md (lean — pointers to L2, not content)
- L2: design/ directory, installed skills, per-module docs
- L3: Reference files, scripts, detailed specs

### 3. Write L1 — CLAUDE.md

Create CLAUDE.md with only what changes agent decisions:

1. **One-line project description** — what is this
2. **Build/test/run commands** — the exact commands, no explanation
3. **Architecture** — module boundaries and how they connect (or pointer 
   to design/ if it exists). ASCII diagram if helpful.
4. **Non-obvious conventions** — naming patterns, file organization rules, 
   architectural constraints that aren't visible from code structure

Run the litmus test on every line before including it.

If other AI tool configs exist (.cursorrules, etc.), update them too — 
but keep the source of truth in one place and point others to it.

### 4. Set up L2 if needed

For medium+ projects, the most common L2 need is architectural documentation 
— a `design/` directory with module boundaries, data flow, key mechanisms, 
and decision records. This gives the agent the structural awareness to work 
within the system's shape rather than guessing. The design-driven skill can 
help bootstrap this.

Also check:
- Are installed skills' L1 metadata (description) precise enough for 
  trigger matching?
- Are there existing docs that should be promoted to L2?

### 5. Set up hooks if applicable

Identify mechanical checks that should run automatically:

- Are there common mistakes the agent makes that a hook could catch?
- Are there formatting/linting rules that should be enforced pre-commit?
- Would a design-change reminder help? (e.g. warn when design/ and 
  source files are staged together)

Hooks are zero-cost in context but high-value in consistency.

### 6. Review with the human

Present the proposed structure:

```
L1 (always loaded)
  └── CLAUDE.md — [summary of contents, token estimate]

L2 (on activation)
  └── [whatever was set up]

L3 (on demand)
  └── [whatever was set up]

Hooks
  └── [whatever was set up]
```

Call out any judgment calls you made about what belongs at which layer.
Don't commit until the human confirms.
