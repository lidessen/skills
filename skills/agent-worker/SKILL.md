name: agent-worker
description: Create and manage AI agent sessions with multiple backends (SDK, Claude CLI, Codex, Cursor). Also supports multi-agent workflows with shared context, @mention coordination, and collaborative voting. Use for "start agent session", "create worker", "run agent", "multi-agent workflow", "agent collaboration", "test with tools", or when orchestrating AI conversations programmatically.

# Agent Worker

## Who You Are

You build AI-powered workflows. You want programmatic control over AI conversations—whether single-agent sessions or multi-agent collaboration.

**Two modes**:
- **Sessions**: Single agent, persistent state, tool injection, approval workflows
- **Workflows**: Multiple agents, shared context, @mention coordination, voting

You're here to create sessions, orchestrate agents, manage tools—all from the command line.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a session (SDK backend, default)
agent-worker new -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

# Create with Claude CLI backend
agent-worker new -b claude

# Send a message (async by default)
agent-worker send "What is 2+2?"

# Check the response
agent-worker peek

# Or send and wait for immediate response
agent-worker send "What is 3+3?" --wait

# End session
agent-worker agent end
```

That's it. Session persists across commands. State maintained until you end it.

**Note**: `send` is async by default (non-blocking). Use `peek` to view responses, or add `--wait` for synchronous behavior.

---

## Choosing a Backend

| Backend | Best For | Model Selection |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `sdk` (default) | Full control, tool injection, mocking | `-m provider/model` |
| `claude` | Use existing Claude CLI installation | CLI's own model |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex workflows | CLI's own model |
| `cursor` | Cursor Agent integration | CLI's own model |

```bash
# Check what's available
agent-worker backends

# SDK backend with specific model
agent-worker new -m openai/gpt-5.2

# CLI backends
agent-worker new -b claude
agent-worker new -b codex
agent-worker new -b cursor
```

**Important Notes**:
- Tool management (add, mock, import) only works with SDK backend
- Claude CLI backend may not work properly within Claude Code environment itself (use SDK backend for testing)
- Async requests timeout after 60 seconds to prevent indefinite hangs

---

## Session Management

### Creating Sessions

```bash
# Basic session
agent-worker new

# With custom system prompt
agent-worker new -s "You are a code reviewer."

# From file
agent-worker new -f ./prompts/reviewer.txt

# Named session (easier reference)
agent-worker new -n my-session

# Custom idle timeout (ms, 0 = no timeout)
agent-worker new --idle-timeout 3600000

# With scheduled wakeup (see Scheduled Wakeup section)
agent-worker new --wakeup 5m
agent-worker new --wakeup "0 */2 * * *"
```

### Multiple Sessions

```bash
# List all
agent-worker ls

# Switch default
agent-worker agent use my-session

# Target specific session
agent-worker send "Hello" --to my-session

# End specific
agent-worker agent end my-session

# End all
agent-worker agent end --all
```

### Session Info

```bash
# Status
agent-worker agent status

# Statistics (tokens, messages)
agent-worker stats

# View messages (default: last 10)
agent-worker peek
agent-worker peek --last 5          # Show last 5 messages
agent-worker peek --all             # Show all messages
agent-worker peek --find "error"    # Search messages containing "error"

# Export full transcript
agent-worker export > transcript.json

# Clear messages (keep session)
agent-worker clear
```

---

## Tool Management (SDK Backend Only)

### Adding Tools

```bash
# Simple tool
agent-worker tool add get_weather \
  -d "Get weather for a location" \
  -p "location:string:City name"

# With approval requirement
agent-worker tool add delete_file \
  -d "Delete a file" \
  -p "path:string:File path" \
  --needs-approval
```

### Importing Tools from File

```typescript
// my-tools.ts
export default [
  {
    name: 'search_docs',
    description: 'Search documentation',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        query: { type: 'string', description: 'Search query' }
      },
      required: ['query']
    },
    execute: async (args) => {
      // Real implementation
      return { results: ['doc1', 'doc2'] }
    }
  }
]
```

```bash
agent-worker tool import ./my-tools.ts
```

### Mocking Tools

```bash
# Set static mock response
agent-worker tool mock get_weather '{"temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"}'

# List tools
agent-worker tool list
```

---

## Approval Workflow

For tools marked `needsApproval`:

```bash
# Send message that triggers tool
agent-worker send "Delete /tmp/test.txt"

# Check pending approvals
agent-worker pending

# Approve
agent-worker approve <approval-id>

# Deny with reason
agent-worker deny <approval-id> -r "Path not allowed"
```

---

## Model Formats

SDK backend supports multiple formats:

```bash
# Gateway format (recommended)
agent-worker new -m openai/gpt-5.2
agent-worker new -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

# Provider-only (uses provider's frontier model)
agent-worker new -m openai
agent-worker new -m anthropic

# Direct provider format
agent-worker new -m deepseek:deepseek-chat
```

Check available providers:
```bash
agent-worker providers
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Testing a Prompt

```bash
# Create session with your system prompt
agent-worker new -f ./my-prompt.txt -n test

# Run test cases (async)
agent-worker send "Test case 1: ..." --to test
agent-worker send "Test case 2: ..." --to test

# Check responses
agent-worker peek --to test

# Or send synchronously for quick tests
agent-worker send "Test case 3: ..." --to test --wait

# Clean up
agent-worker agent end test
```

### Tool Development

```bash
# Start session
agent-worker new -n dev

# Add tool with mock
agent-worker tool add my_api -d "Call my API" -p "endpoint:string"
agent-worker tool mock my_api '{"status": "ok"}'

# Test
agent-worker send "Call my API at /users"

# Update mock, test again
agent-worker tool mock my_api '{"status": "error", "code": 500}'
agent-worker send "Call my API at /users"
```

### Multi-Backend Comparison

```bash
# Same prompt, different backends
agent-worker new -m anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 -n anthropic
agent-worker new -b claude -n claude-cli

agent-worker send "Explain recursion" --to anthropic
agent-worker send "Explain recursion" --to claude-cli

# Compare responses
agent-worker peek --to anthropic
agent-worker peek --to claude-cli
```

---

## Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { AgentSession } from 'agent-worker'

const session = new AgentSession({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5',
  system: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  tools: [/* your tools */]
})

// Send message
const response = await session.send('Hello')
console.log(response.content)
console.log(response.toolCalls)
console.log(response.usage)

// Stream
for await (const chunk of session.sendStream('Tell me a story')) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk)
}

// Get state for persistence
const state = session.getState()
```

---

## Scheduled Wakeup

Agents can be configured to wake up periodically. Two modes:

| Mode | Format | Behavior |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Interval** | `60000`, `30s`, `5m`, `2h` | Fires after idle. Resets on any activity. |
| **Cron** | `0 */2 * * *` | Fixed schedule. NOT reset by activity. |

### At creation

```bash
# Wake every 5 minutes of inactivity
agent-worker new --wakeup 5m

# Wake every 2 hours (fixed, cron)
agent-worker new --wakeup "0 */2 * * *"

# With custom wakeup prompt
agent-worker new --wakeup 30s --wakeup-prompt "Check for new tasks"
```

### Runtime management

```bash
# Set wakeup on running agent
agent-worker agent schedule set 5m
agent-worker agent schedule set "0 */2 * * *" -p "Run health check"

# View current schedule
agent-worker agent schedule get

# Remove wakeup
agent-worker agent schedule clear
```

### Format detection

The `--wakeup` value is automatically detected:
- Pure number → **ms interval** (e.g., `60000` = 60s)
- Duration string → **interval** (e.g., `30s`, `5m`, `2h`, `1d`)
- Otherwise → **cron expression** (5-field: min hour dom month dow)

**Interval** resets its timer whenever the agent handles activity (external sends, etc). It measures "time since last active."

**Cron** fires at fixed wall-clock times regardless of agent activity.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No active session" | Run `agent-worker new` first |
| "Session not found" | Check `agent-worker ls` |
| "Tool management not supported" | Use SDK backend (`-b sdk` or omit `-b`) |
| "Provider not loaded" | Check API key with `agent-worker providers` |
| Agent not responding | Check if process alive: `agent-worker agent status` |
| Message stuck in "(processing...)" | Wait up to 60s (timeout), or check with `--debug` |
| Send appears to hang | Use `agent-worker send "message" --debug` to see details |
| Claude backend not working | Use SDK backend instead (Claude CLI has environment limitations) |

## Multi-Agent Workflows

For complex tasks requiring multiple specialized agents:

```yaml
# review.yaml
agents:
  reviewer:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    system_prompt: You review code for quality.
  coder:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    system_prompt: You fix issues found by reviewers.

setup:
  - shell: gh pr diff
    as: diff

kickoff: |
  ${{ diff }}
  @reviewer please review. When issues found, @coder to fix.
```

```bash
# Run workflow (exits when complete)
agent-worker run review.yaml

# Or keep running
agent-worker start review.yaml

# Parallel instances
agent-worker run review.yaml --instance pr-123
```

### Shared Context

Agents collaborate through two spaces:

| Space | Purpose | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Channel** | Communication (@mentions) | `channel_send`, `channel_read`, `inbox_read` |
| **Document** | Shared workspace | `document_read`, `document_write`, `document_append` |

### Proposal & Voting

For collaborative decisions:

```bash
# In agent's tool calls:
proposal_create  # Create election/decision/approval
vote             # Cast vote on proposal
proposal_status  # Check results
```

Resolution types: `plurality`, `majority`, `unanimous`. Quorum defaults to all agents.

See [reference/workflow.md](reference/workflow.md) for full configuration.

## Remember

agent-worker is about **programmatic control** over AI conversations.

- **Sessions**: Single agent, persistent state, tool injection
- **Workflows**: Multi-agent, shared context, @mention coordination
- **Backends**: SDK, Claude, Codex, Cursor
- **Testing**: Mocks, approval workflows

不是手动对话，而是工程化的 AI 交互。
