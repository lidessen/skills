  Design-driven development methodology. The design/ directory is the single 
  source of architectural truth — read it before coding, stay within its 
  boundaries, and when the system's shape needs to change, update the design 
  first.

  Use this skill whenever starting any development work on this project. Also 
  use when the user asks to: create or update architecture docs, add a new 
  module or feature that might cross existing boundaries, refactor system 
  structure, or understand the codebase architecture. Trigger on phrases like 
  "design first", "update the design", "does this change the architecture", 
  "write a design for", "what's the current design", or when onboarding to 
  understand a codebase's shape.

  Supports arguments: `/design-driven init` to configure a project for 
  design-driven development, `/design-driven bootstrap` to generate design 
  from an existing codebase, `/design-driven audit` to reconcile an existing 
  design/ against the current code.

# Design-Driven Development

A mini methodology: design/ is the skeleton, code is the muscle. 
Human shapes the skeleton, agent builds the muscle.

design/ is also the institutional memory that outlives any single agent 
session. Agents are ephemeral, but the architectural skeleton persists — 
each new agent reads it, works within its boundaries, and leaves the 
codebase in a state the next agent can trust.

## Commands

When invoked with an argument, dispatch to the corresponding file:

- `/design-driven init` → Read and follow `commands/init.md`.
  One-time project plumbing: agent configs, empty directories, optional 
  hooks. Does not generate DESIGN.md.
- `/design-driven bootstrap` → Read and follow `commands/bootstrap.md`.
  Generate the initial `design/DESIGN.md` from an existing codebase. 
  Idempotently handles plumbing if `init` wasn't run first.
- `/design-driven audit` → Read and follow `commands/audit.md`.
  Reconcile an existing `design/` against the current code: find drift, 
  classify findings, propose updates or retroactive proposals.
- No argument → Continue with the methodology below (the normal loop).

**Which command when:**

- Brand new project, no code yet → `init`, then write DESIGN.md by hand
- Existing codebase, no `design/` → `bootstrap` (does init-style plumbing too)
- `design/` exists, starting a task → no argument (normal loop)
- `design/` exists and feels stale, or code has drifted → `audit`

## Directory Structure

```
project/
├── design/                                        ← Permanent skeleton
│   ├── DESIGN.md                                  ← System shape
│   ├── DESIGN-<aspect>.md                         ← Complex mechanisms (optional)
│   └── decisions/
│       ├── 001-outbox-over-direct-push.md         ← adopted
│       └── 002-split-memory-tiers.md              ← rejected
│
└── blueprints/                                    ← Implementation records
    ├── add-semantic-memory-search.md              ← done (clean, no TODO)
    └── refactor-agent-delegation.md               ← in-progress (has TODO)
```

Two directories, clear separation: `design/` is the architect's drawings 
(system shape, permanent), `blueprints/` is the builder's records 
(task-level approach, kept for reference).

## The 30/70 Principle

The design/ directory captures 30% — the critical skeleton. 
The agent has 70% freedom.

**The 30% (in design/):**
- Module boundaries — what exists, what each does and doesn't do
- Data flow — how information moves through the system
- Key mechanisms — patterns that define system behavior
- Tradeoffs — choices where you picked A over B, and why

**The 70% (agent decides freely):**
- API design, function signatures, error handling
- Data structures, algorithms, file organization
- Internal module architecture, naming, patterns

**Litmus test:** If changing it would change the system's *shape*, it's the 30%. 
If it changes *behavior within the same shape*, it's the 70%.

The 30% constraint applies across the **entire development cycle**, not 
just during "architecture tasks". design/ is a constant frame; every 
phase — coding, testing, reviewing, debugging, refactoring, releasing, 
deprecating — operates inside it. Design-driven isn't one stage of the 
workflow; it's the skeleton every stage hangs on.

## Across the development cycle

Every activity inherits the same 30% constraint and the same 70% 
freedom. design/ doesn't dictate *how* each activity runs — it sets 
what they all must respect.

- **Planning** — read DESIGN.md first; scope the task against existing 
  modules and non-goals
- **Coding** — stay within the owning module's boundaries
- **Testing** — test at module boundaries and named mechanisms; 
  internal behavior that isn't in DESIGN.md is 70% territory
- **Code review** — design-level comments (boundary violation, silent 
  shape drift, missing proposal) take priority over style nits
- **Debugging** — locate the bug in its module. If the real fix would 
  cross a boundary, that's a proposal signal, not a clever patch
- **Refactoring** — within a module: free. Crossing modules or 
  changing a mechanism: proposal first
- **Release / rollback** — shape changes ship together with their 
  adopted proposal; rollback preserves the skeleton
- **Deprecation** — removing a module or mechanism is a shape change 
  → proposal
- **Onboarding** — new contributors read DESIGN.md before the code

When an activity isn't listed here, the rule is the same: ask whether 
the action stays within the shape (70% — proceed) or changes it (30% 
— proposal).

## The Loop

Every development task follows one path:

```
  ┌───────────────────────────────┐
  │  Read design/DESIGN.md        │  ← Always start here
  │  Understand the skeleton      │
  └────────────┬──────────────────┘
               │
       ┌───────▼────────┐
       │ Does this task  │
       │ change the      │
       │ system's shape? │
       └───┬─────────┬───┘
           │         │
          NO        YES
           │         │
           │    ┌────▼───────────────────┐
           │    │ Write proposal in      │
           │    │ design/decisions/      │  ← Context + proposal + alternatives
           │    └────┬───────────────────┘
           │         │
           │    ┌────▼───────────────────┐
           │    │ Human reviews          │  ← Wait. Don't code until approved.
           │    └────┬───────────────────┘
           │         │
           │    ┌────▼───────────────────┐
           │    │ Update design/DESIGN.md│  ← Commit design change separately
           │    └────┬───────────────────┘
           │         │
       ┌───▼─────────▼───┐
       │   Plan           │  ← Draw the blueprint, set up scaffolding
       ├──────────────────┤
       │   Build          │  ← Code freely, track progress on scaffolding
       ├──────────────────┤
       │   Verify         │  ← Check against blueprint, tear down scaffolding
       └──────────────────┘
```

**"Changes the shape"** = adding/removing/merging modules, changing how modules 
connect, altering a key mechanism, introducing a new architectural pattern. 
Use the 30/70 litmus test above: if you're unsure, it probably doesn't — just code.

## Implementation: Plan → Build → Verify → Close out

**Plan** — Before drafting, you need two things: **current state** and 
**pending claims** on the area you're about to touch.

*Current state* lives in:
- `design/DESIGN.md` — the shape
- The relevant source code — the implementation

*Pending claims* live in:
- `blueprints/` — `in-progress` files that may conflict with your work
- Recent done blueprints' `## Follow-ups` sections — scope-shaved work 
  that may be exactly what your task is, or what it depends on
- `design/decisions/` — any proposal currently in `proposed` state 
  blocks source edits in its area until resolved

Past blueprints are **records, not state**. Don't reconstruct current 
behavior by reading their Approach or (former) State sections — read 
DESIGN.md and the code. If those two disagree, that's drift; stop and 
run `/design-driven audit` rather than layer new work on a stale 
skeleton.

Then write `blueprints/<task-name>.md` with approach, scope, and 
verification criteria upfront — how will you know this task is done? 
The TODO and State sections are scaffolding: progress trackers, not 
specs. See `references/templates.md` for the format.

Size tasks to fit within a single session. A workable heuristic: a 
blueprint should fit in ~10 TODO items, and its State section should 
contain enough context that a fresh agent could resume from the 
blueprint alone. If a task blows past either, split it.

**Build** — Code freely within design/ boundaries, following the blueprint's 
approach. Check off TODO items as you go. If you discover a better approach 
mid-build, update the blueprint first, then continue. Update the State 
section with decisions made and current progress, so work can resume if 
the session is interrupted. When a build-time decision is borderline 
(technically 70% but not obvious), log it in State so review can catch it.

**Verify** — Check the implementation against the verification criteria 
defined in Plan. Confirm: does it stay within design/ boundaries? Is 
the scope respected?

A failing test (or an observation during verify) that reveals something 
DESIGN.md doesn't account for is a **signal about design silence**, not 
a bug to patch around. Either fix DESIGN.md (doc-only drift), raise a 
proposal (shape-level), or add to Constraints / Non-goals — don't mute 
the test.

**Close out** — This step is what keeps DESIGN.md **current state** 
rather than a historical snapshot. Skipping it rots the skeleton 
silently; future tasks can no longer trust DESIGN.md, and the whole 
methodology collapses. Not optional.

Before tearing down scaffolding, reconcile:

- **Doc-only drift** — did this task make any statement in DESIGN.md 
  less accurate? A boundary widened, a mechanism gained a dimension, 
  a constraint became visible, a module's "doesn't" list needs an 
  addition. Update DESIGN.md now, commit separately from code. This 
  is the mechanism that lets the next task just read DESIGN.md and 
  trust it — no archaeology required.
- **Follow-ups** — scope-shaved items worth doing later. Add a 
  `## Follow-ups` section with names and one-line intents. These are 
  forward-looking pending claims — the next task in this area picks 
  them up via its pending-claims scan.
- **Recurring pattern** — if this task's approach is likely to repeat 
  (e.g., "every new read endpoint extends query() with a filter arg"), 
  promote it into DESIGN.md's Key Mechanisms so future tasks inherit 
  it without re-deriving.

Then strip the TODO and State sections (keep Follow-ups), mark status 
as `done`, commit the blueprint with the code.

The blueprint sits between design/ and code in granularity:

```
design/      "The system has a memory layer with shared facts and 
              per-conversation short-term context"

blueprint    "Add semantic search to memory: integrate embedding model, 
              build index on startup, query during context assembly. 
              Reuse existing IMemoryManager interface."

code         The actual embedder, vector store, query functions, tests
```

**Skip the blueprint** for bug fixes, small config changes, or tasks that 
take less time to do than to plan. Skipping the blueprint does not skip 
the design constraint — you still work inside DESIGN.md's boundaries, 
you just don't need a written plan to do it.

**After verify** — done blueprints stay in `blueprints/` as a historical 
record. They're not the next task's source of truth (DESIGN.md + code 
is); they're audit trails and the home for Follow-ups. The folder 
grows over time; if it gets unwieldy, move older ones under 
`blueprints/archive/` rather than deleting them.

## Proposals and Decisions

When a task requires changing the system's shape:

1. Write a proposal in `design/decisions/NNN-title.md`, where `NNN` is 
   the next unused three-digit number — scan `design/decisions/`, take 
   max+1, pad to three digits (start at `001` if empty). See 
   `references/templates.md` for the format.
2. Wait for the human to review. Do not edit source code until the 
   proposal is marked `adopted` or `rejected`.
3. If adopted: update DESIGN.md, mark proposal adopted, commit both together.
4. If rejected: record why in Outcome, mark rejected.
5. Then implement freely within the (new) boundaries.

Adopted proposals update DESIGN.md — the proposal file stays as the reasoning 
record. Rejected proposals stay too — so the next person with the same idea 
can see why it was already considered.

## Reading an Existing Design

When design/DESIGN.md already exists, read it before every task. Pay attention to:

1. **Module boundaries** — Which module owns the thing you're touching?
2. **"Doesn't do"** — Is the task something a module explicitly doesn't do?
3. **Key mechanisms** — Does your approach align with established patterns?
4. **Non-goals** — Is the feature explicitly out of scope?

If the task fits within boundaries, just implement — no need to explain yourself.
If it conflicts, surface the conflict before writing code.

## Creating or Updating a Design

- No `design/DESIGN.md` yet → run `/design-driven bootstrap` to explore 
  the codebase and generate the first version. See `references/templates.md` 
  for the DESIGN.md structure and `references/writing-guide.md` for style.
- `design/DESIGN.md` exists but feels out of sync with the code → 
  run `/design-driven audit` to collect drift and reconcile.

→ plan → build → verify — see `references/example.md`.
